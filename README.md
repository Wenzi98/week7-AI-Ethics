# AI Ethics & Auditing Project

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and practical application of ethical principles in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. The project is designed to demonstrate a theoretical understanding of AI bias, fairness, transparency, and accountability through case study evaluations, ethical reflections, and real-world implementation examples.

## Part 1: Theoretical Understanding

This section explores foundational concepts in AI ethics through a series of short-answer questions and principle-matching exercises.

### Key Topics

- **Algorithmic Bias**: How historical inequalities affect modern AI systems.
- **Transparency vs. Explainability**: The importance of user understanding and trust in AI decisions.
- **Impact of GDPR on AI**: How European regulations enforce data privacy, consent, and accountability.
- **Core Ethical Principles**: Justice, non-maleficence, autonomy, and sustainability as guiding values in AI design.

## Part 2: Case Study Analysis

### Case 1: Biased Hiring Tool

- **Problem**: Gender bias in Amazonâ€™s AI recruiting system.
- **Root Causes**: Skewed training data, biased feature engineering, and reinforcing feedback loops.
- **Proposed Solutions**:
  - Rebalancing training data
  - Real-time bias auditing
  - Redefining performance metrics to be more inclusive
- **Fairness Metrics**:
  - Demographic parity
  - False negative rate gap
  - Rescue rate of falsely rejected applications

### Case 2: Facial Recognition in Policing

- **Ethical Risks**:
  - Wrongful arrests due to racial misidentification
  - Mass surveillance and erosion of privacy
  - Reinforced systemic discrimination
- **Policy Recommendations**:
  - Judicial oversight for AI deployment
  - Error disparity thresholds
  - Transparent usage logs and compensation systems

## Part 3: Practical Implementation

Included in the `Practical Audit.ipynb` notebook is an applied audit simulation that reflects the concepts discussed in the theoretical sections. The notebook may include:

- Data fairness analysis
- Bias detection methods
- Ethical evaluation of model predictions
- Suggested improvements and accountability frameworks

---

## Part 4: Ethical Reflection

This section presents a reflective analysis on designing an AI system for predicting extreme weather patterns for farmers.

### Highlights

- **User-Centered Design**: Conducting interviews with small-scale farmers to tailor AI outputs.
- **Bias Evaluation**: Testing performance across geographies, economic classes, and climate zones.
- **Transparency Measures**:
  - Data sources and confidence levels displayed to users
  - Real-time support and emergency contact integration
- **Resilience Planning**:
  - Equipment distribution to underserved areas
  - Disaster recovery plans when AI fails

## Bonus: Healthcare AI Ethics Guidelines

A proposed ethical framework for AI in healthcare environments, focusing on:

### 1. Informed Consent

- Plain-language communication
- Re-consent protocols
- Emergency use conditions

### 2. Bias Mitigation

- Regular audits across demographic groups
- Diverse and representative datasets
- Auto-shutdown on bias detection

### 3. Transparency and Accountability

- Clear diagnostic explanations
- Public error logs and annual report cards
- Designated roles for AI oversight and patient advocacy

## Conclusion

This project reflects a deep engagement with both theoretical and practical dimensions of ethical AI. It advocates for fairness, transparency, and inclusivity in automated decision-making systems, with applicable strategies for both technical and policy-level interventions.
